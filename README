## 🌈 What is DSA？

DSA means Data Structures and Algorithms，which is extremely important 💪 for advanced JavaScript.

Data structures are used to store the data in a specific structure and algorithms are the process in order to solve the given problem.

## 🌟 Why DSA?

DSA plays a vital role for all the learners who are willing to get a good job, which will entirely change your approach towards coding.👏

### 🎨 How to learn DSA?

Learning DSA is not just reading explanations or watching courses related to DSA, you must know how it work internally and how to deal with it. 📌 To do this, you must **practice** it, **apply** it, get hands on **experience** immediately after knowing about it.
