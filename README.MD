## Content

- 💻 [Data Structures](https://dsa.jonsam.site/ds/)
- 🧮 [Algorithms](https://dsa.jonsam.site/algorithm/)
- 🔭 [LeetCode](https://dsa.jonsam.site/leetcode/)

### Why DSA？

DSA plays a vital role for all the learners who are willing to get a good job, which will entirely change your approach towards coding. Data structures are used to store the data in a specific format and Algorithms are nothing but the process which you implement in order to solve the given problem statement.

### How to learn DSA?

Learning DSA is not just reading about DSA or watching videos or explanations related to it, you must know how it work internally and how to deal with it. To do this, you must practice it , apply it , get hands on experience immediately after knowing about it.
