## 实现

### JavaScript

```js
/*
The density of a network is a measure of how many edges exist proportional to
how many edges would exist in a complete network (where all possible edges).
https://networkx.org/documentation/networkx-1.9/reference/generated/networkx.classes.function.density.html
*/
function density (numberOfNodes, numberOfEdges, isDirected = false) {
  const multi = isDirected ? 1 : 2
  return (multi * numberOfEdges) / (numberOfNodes * (numberOfNodes - 1))
}

export { density }
```
